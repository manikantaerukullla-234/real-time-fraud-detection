This project is a machine learning–based system that detects fraudulent transactions in real time using Python. A trained ML model predicts whether a transaction is FRAUD or SAFE, and the result is delivered instantly through a Flask API. The project demonstrates how real banking fraud detection systems work and is hosted on GitHub.
